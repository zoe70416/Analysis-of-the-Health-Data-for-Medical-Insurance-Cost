# Analysis-of-the-Health-Data-for-Medical-Insurance-Cost

## Introduction
In the domain of health insurance, a variety of factors influence a customer’s premium price (cost of
insurance), and the process of setting premium prices is typically carried out by the pricing and
underwriting department. As data is more accessible and easily stored, the healthcare industry
generates a large amount of data related to patients, diseases, and diagnoses, but this data has not been
properly analyzed, leading to a lack of understanding of its significance and its potential impact on patient
healthcare costs. Since there are several factors that can affect the cost of healthcare or insurance, it is
important for a variety of stakeholders and health departments to accurately predict individual healthcare
expenses using prediction models. The goal of this project is to properly analyze the patient’s data to
design models to accurately predict the premium price and also observe significant characteristics of the
data.
